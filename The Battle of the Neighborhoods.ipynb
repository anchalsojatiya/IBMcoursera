Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an Drug Store in Brooklyn,New York,USA.\n\nSince there are lots of Drug Stores in New York we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with Drugstores. We are also particularly interested in areas with no Drug Stores in vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible.\n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.",
